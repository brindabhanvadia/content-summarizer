Web Scraping - Content Summarization using Beautiful Soup

This Python project fetches a webpage's content and summarizes its text using Beautiful Soup and a summarization algorithm. It is designed to provide concise and relevant insights from lengthy web pages in just a few steps.

Features

Fetch Webpages: Retrieve HTML content from any given URL.

Extract Textual Content: Parse and clean the webpage content to focus on relevant text.

Summarize Content: Generate a brief summary of the extracted content.

Command-Line Interface: Input a URL and get the summary directly in your terminal.

Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.7+

Required Python libraries:

beautifulsoup4

requests

nltk (optional, if used in your summarizer)

Project Structure

main.py: The entry point of the project.

scraper.py: Contains functions for fetching and extracting content from a webpage.

summarizer.py: Contains the logic for summarizing the extracted content.

How It Works

Fetching Webpage: The fetch_webpage function in scraper.py retrieves the HTML content using the requests library.

Extracting Content: The extract_content function parses the HTML using BeautifulSoup to extract relevant text.

Summarizing: The summarize_content function processes the text to produce a summary.

Limitations

May not handle JavaScript-heavy websites effectively (use libraries like Selenium for such cases).

The summarization quality depends on the implementation in summarizer.py.
